# Instructions for setting up a fully automated kitchensink application with CI/CD Pipeline

1. oc login <openshift_env>

2. Setup separate projects which includes gogs, sonarqube, nexus, jenkins and pipeline
./provision_base.sh deploy --project-suffix test-npatel --domain-name apps.2245.openshift.opentlc.com

3. Setup Environments for Development, Staging and Production
./provision.sh deploy --project-suffix test-npatel

4. Login into gogs and do following:
- Create a new user... username/password as developer/developer
- Create a new org called "CICDLabs"
- Under that org create a new repository called "kitchensink" and clone code from "https://github.com/npatel2012/kitchensink-lab"

5. Kick start the pipeline manually which you will find in the "Jenkins" project


# Nest Steps not included as part of Automation
- Attach database to the kichensink application in Dev, Staging and Production environments
- more CANDO tasks for the future

# Troubleshooting options:
If the nexus pod doesn't come up then do following:
- change the "docker.io/sonatype/nexus3:3.6.0" imagestream to point to "docker.io/sonatype/nexus3:latest" instead.... This is because 3.6.0 is not available in the Openshift ENVIRONMENT
